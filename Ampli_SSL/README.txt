# Before replacing your /opt/zeek/share/zeek/base/protocols/ssl/main.zeek file with the one provided, it is
# strongly recommended to make a copy of the original file.

# The lines included in the include_to_local.zeek.txt file should be added at the botton of your 
# /zeek/share/zeek/site/local.zeek file.

# Then, include the ampli_files.zeek file in your zeek/share/zeek/base/protocols/ssl/ directory.
